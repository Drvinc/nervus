# Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB)

Content, instructions, and scoring of the FAB[^source]:
## 1. Similarities (conceptualization)
:::info 
“In what way are they alike?” 
:::
* A banana and an orange
* A table and a chair
* A tulip, a rose and a daisy

(In the event of total failure: “they are not alike” or partial failure: “both have peel,” help the patient by saying: “both a banana and an orange are...”; but credit 0 for the item; do not help the patient for the two following items)
```
Score (only category responses [fruits, furniture, flowers] are considered correct):
- Three correct: 3
- Two correct: 2
- One correct: 1
- None correct: 0
```
## 2. Lexical fluency (mental flexibility)
:::info
“Say as many words as you can beginning with the letter ‘S,’ any words except surnames or proper nouns.”
:::
If the patient gives no response during the first 5 seconds, say: “for instance, snake.” If the patient pauses 10 seconds, stimulate him by saying: “any word beginning with the letter ‘S.’ The time allowed is ==60 seconds.==

```
Score (word repetitions or variations [shoe, shoemaker], surnames, or proper nouns are not counted as correct responses):
- More than nine words: 3
- Six to nine words: 2
- Three to five words: 1
- Less than three words: 0
```
## 3. Luria's motor series (programming)
:::info
“Look carefully at what I’m doing.”
:::
The examiner, seated in front of the patient, performs alone three times with his left hand the series of Luria ==“fist–edge–palm.”== “Now, with your right hand do the same series, first with me, then alone.” The examiner performs the series three times with the patient, then says to him/her: “Now, do it on your own.”

```
Score:
- Patient performs six correct consecutive series alone: 3
- Patient performs at least three correct consecutive series alone: 2
- Patient fails alone, but performs three correct consecutive series with the examiner: 1
- Patient cannot perform three correct consecutive series even with the examiner: 0
```
## 4. Conflicting instructions (sensitivity to interference)
:::info 
“Tap twice when I tap once.”
:::
To be sure that the patient has understood the instruction, a series of three trials is run: 1-1-1. ==“Tap once when I tap twice.”== To be sure that the patient has understood the instruction, a series of three trials is run: 2-2-2. The examiner performs the following
series: ==1-1-2-1-2-2-2-1-1-2.==

```
Score:
- No error: 3
- One or two errors: 2
- More than two errors: 1
- Patient taps like the examiner at least four consecutive times: 0
```
## 5. Go–No Go (inhibitory control)
:::info
“Tap once when I tap once.”
:::
To be sure that the patient has understood the instruction, a series of three trials is run: 1-1-1. ==“Do not tap when I tap twice.”== To be sure that the patient has understood the instruction, a series of three trials is run: 2-2-2. The examiner performs the following series: ==1-1-2-1-2-2-2-1-1-2.==

```
Score: 
- No error: 3
- One or two errors: 2
- More than two errors: 1
- Patient taps like the examiner at least four consecutive times: 0
```
## 6. Prehension behavior (environmental autonomy)
:::info
“Do not take my hands.”
:::
The examiner is seated in front of the patient. Place the patient’s hands palm up on his/her knees. Without saying anything or looking at the patient, the examiner brings his/her hands close to the patient’s hands and touches the palms of both the patient’s hands, to see if he/she will spontaneously take them. If the patient takes the hands, the examiner will try again after asking him/her: “Now, do not take my hands.”
```
Score:
- Patient does not take the examiner’s hands: 3
- Patient hesitates and asks what he/she has to do: 2
- Patient takes the hands without hesitation: 1
- Patient takes the examiner’s hand even after he/she has been told not to do so: 0
